# Pyschological Momentum Analysis

# Inspiration
This analysis of pyschological momentum is inspired by the "Turning the Tide: Plays and Psychological Momentum in the NFL" paper presented at the 2012 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference by Aaron W. Johnson, Alexander J. Stimpson, and Torin K. Clark.

# Background
One doesn't need to watch American football for long before being introduced to the term 'momentum.' But what is it, how does it affect football, and is it even real? These are questions this analysis seeks to understand.

The concept of pyschological momentum (PM) in football is prevalent. A team scores a touchdown and suddenly 'has momentum' but then throw an interception on the next drive and has now 'lost the momentum' to the other team. These big plays seem like they have the power to change the course of the game, but showing their impact on teams' future performance is difficult. By analyzing NFL data from 1999-2019, this analysis shows the impact that big defensive (BD) plays have on the same team's ensuing offensive possession. By analyzing the first play, first set of downs, and overall drive result following a BD plays, we can see how successful team's offenses are following BD plays and compare that to drives not following BD plays.
